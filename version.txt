The following is a list of changes per release:

1.7 (2013-07-04)
Added a new mail store to save received messages as EML files

1.6 (2005-04-04)
Fixed threading and synchronization problems (sourceforge tracker id: 1111796). Thanks to Charles Hudak for pointing
out these issues.
Build now fails on unit test failure (sourceforge tracker id: 1115202). Thanks to Charles Hudak for complaining about
this.
Fixed a few more threading issues related to the time required for the server socket to bind. Thanks to Jeremy Hulford
for researching and providing a fix for this issue.


1.5 (2004-11-18)
Moved from LGPL license to Apache License Version 2.0. See http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt.
This provides at least the same freedoms as the LGPL license but does not have the potential legal problems
associated with imports from other libraries.
Removed vestiges of port 25 from unit tests to allow OSX and *nix to run on non-priveleged ports.


1.4 (2004-11-2)
Fixed bug where misbehaving SMTP clients cause Dumbster to fail with a NullPointerException (sourceforge tracker id:
1055322).
Binary distribution (jar with class files) now available in addition to source (sourceforge tracker id: 1059102).
Corrected mispelling of SimpleSmtpServer.getReceivedEmailSize() again (can't believe how long I stared at this
until I saw it - thanks to Ken Pelletier).
Stopped using port 25 and 80 in unit tests - these are priveleged ports under *nix and OSX (thanks to Ken Pelletier
and Mark Lowe).
Uncommented stack trace on server startup failure (this probably ought to throw an IllegalStateException or something,
but at least this way any failure won't be hidden) - thanks Ken Pelletier.
CVS now operational for the Dumbster project.
Added javadoc target to "build.xml".


1.3 (2004-10-08)
Documented internal state transition table (see Javadoc for SmtpRequest).
Fixed bug which prevented mutliple messages in the same connection from being transferred (sourceforge tracker id:
1022357).


1.2 (2004-05-08)
Configurable SMTP port (thanks Dr. Christian Möller and Kevin Fries).
Mispelled getReceievedEmailSize (Sourceforge tracker id: 824194).
Not able to enter '\n' in body of message (sourceforge tracker id: 903326).


1.1 (2003-09-28)
Change from GPL license to LGPL license.
HELO command is now recognized (not just EHLO).
